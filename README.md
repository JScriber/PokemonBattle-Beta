# PokemonBattle BÃªta
## Project's seed
**Pokemon Battle** has been created during August 2015.
At the beginning, the goal of the project was to use animated GIF in order to create a pokemon-like battle into the browser. Entirely coded in HTML/CSS and mainly JavaScript the game allows each user to choose one single Pokemon in a list. Then, both creatures start fighting according to their trainer's will.

## Work left
Indeed, the project is far to be complete. Find hereby the features to add:
- Status issues (poison, etc) ;
- Select more than one Pokemon ;
- The ability to skip a lap ;
- Add special ability to each Pokemon ; 
- So on.

# Other things to mention
The animated images have been found on [Pokemontrash](http://www.pokemontrash.com/pokedex/liste-pokemon.php) without whom nothing would have been possible.

(_An updated and brand new version is on the way..._)
