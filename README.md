# Project's seed
**Pokemon Battle** has been created during August 2015.
At the beginning, the goal of the project was to use animated GIF in order to create a pokemon-like battle into the browser. Entirely coded in HTML/CSS and mainly JavaScript the game allows each user to choose one single Pokemon in a list. Then, both creatures start fighting according to their trainer's will.

# There's still work to be done
Indeed, the project is far to be complete. Find hereby the feature to add:
- Status issues (poison, etc) ;
- Select more than one Pokemon ;
- The ability to skip a lap ;
- Add special ability to each Pokemon ; 
- So on.

# Sneak peek
Here some screenshots.


# Other things to mention
The animated images have been found on Pokemontrash.
